We frequently want to grab only a segment of a highway that lies between two points, when we have a geodataframe containing the whole thing.

Clipping to a box works pretty well, but there's a problem.

The route may wander outside of the bounds of a box built from the start point P and end point Q, when the orientation of the box is EW and NS.

------

One idea is to tilt the box.

I wrote code to compute the orientation o between P -> Q in compass degrees.

Start by computing the distance d from P -> Q, and make the long dimension of the box run along that axis the distance d.

Build a box with sides of width 2w.

The corners are at 
P.x, P.y +/- w; and then P.x + d, P.y +/- w.

Finally, rotate the box by o.
