It's fairly common to find that
part of a highway is missing

Sometimes it's a name issue
Vernal-(UT-CO) US Hwy 40
is actually E US Hwy 40

Durango-Cortez 
US Hwy 160 is missing a section
that part is called Hwy 160

Boulder-Estes Park State Rte 36

Jerome-Sedona different names for 89A

These can be diagnosed with search_CL.py
and usually fixed w/non-strict search and just the number.

-----

(ID-MT)-West Yellowstone,
US Hwy 20 works for MT

what's missing is the next bit in WY
and that is just missing

Silverton-Durango US Hwy 550
from Hermosa to about 10 miles N
is just missing
